# InfernoNLI
"Adversarial-NLI" is a project, focused on enhancing Natural Language Inference (NLI) models through adversarial data augmentation and architectural modifications. The goal is to improve model robustness against challenging test cases using semantic transformations, word sense disambiguation (WSD), and semantic role labeling (SRL)
